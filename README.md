# calamari_models_experimental

Intermediate results of experiments dealing with the training of mixed models for historical Latin script which seem to be somewhat promising/useful. More to follow.

## Models

The models focus on printings using Latin script and Antiqua/Fraktur types.
Training data included works from the 15th to 19th century.

**most recent updates**:
- Added lsh-3 which does not regularize vocal ligatures anymore and only unifies spaces around "real" punctuation (.,:;?!)
- Added lsh-4, i.e. the best model resulting from our experiments described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07881)
