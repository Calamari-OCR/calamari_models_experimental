# calamari_models_experimental

Intermediate results of experiments dealing with the training of mixed models for historical Latin script which seem to be somewhat promising/useful. More to follow.

## Models

The models focus on printings using Latin script and Antiqua/Fraktur types.
Training data included works from the 15th to 19th century.
